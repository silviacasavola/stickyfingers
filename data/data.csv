1,Food ,"Paris, France",27/03/2020,24,Alex,Graphic Designer,"Photography, Design, Illustration",,"Impulsivity, Anxiety, Binge eating","""My mission would be to get up in the morning to go to a grocery store with an empty belly. I have money, but I don't spend any of it. My goal is to get the food in a bag and out of the door without paying for it so that I can binge and purge, as fast as I can, as soon as I can. Every night it's like a Thanksgiving meal. I finally get down to sit and it's like - it's a high. The first couple of bites is the best, after that I'm not even tasting it. I'm in the zone. I physically won't stop eating until it's coming up. Do I see myself as a criminal? Define criminal. I mean, I'm a criminal in terms of the word itself and its definition. But as a person, I am not criminal, I'm sick.""",SF_Food1.png
2,Nail polish,"San Diego, California",17/08/2021,29,Casey,Accountant,"Playing music, Volounteering",Lives alone,"Anxiety, Depression","""I would often steal nail polish because I thought ""Oh, it's small, no one's going to really care if I steal nail polish. I also had a thing for shiny things, things that were very pretty, that looked elegant. I don't really go with big things, because I know I can get caught. I know I can't get away with that, I'm not even going to try to risk it.""",SF_Nail_polish.png
3,Gold plated biro,"Vienna, Austria",03/09/2019,22,Jamie,Student,Dancing,,"Apathy, Depression, Bipolarism","""I'm at the Vatican, looking up at another painting of a crucifixion. I'm also sliding a $34 gold-plated biro down my sleeve and letting it drop out the bottom of my jacket. It disappears into one of my overstuffed pockets and tips my total hoard to about $143 worth of Catholic trinkets. They include tourist baubles for Pope-loving wet nurses, would-be nuns, and repentant masturbators. All little symbols to indicate, ""Hey look, I was at St. Peter's"" and ""I flagellate myself when I think of Elizabeth Warren in an erotic context. To me, they mean nothing. They are just a jumble of pilfered items to add to a collection that has spanned airports, departments stores, libraries, and gift shops the world over: pocketable useless goodies that I just can't not pick up. I nod at the nun behind the counter as I leave.""",SF_Gold_plated_biro.png
4,Broken toy,"London, United Kingdom",30/06/2019,28,Sasha,Software Engineer,"Arts and museums, Travelling, Staying with friends, Clubbing",,"Anxiety, Depression","""When I was a very young kid, I walked into a store with my mom, I saw this broken toy that was just sitting on a shelf and I thought ""Oh, it's broken, no one is going to care that it's gone"", so I took it and put it in my coat pocket and just walked out.""",SF_Broken_toy.png
5,Casino pillows,"Dublin, Ireland",07/11/2021,25,Charlie,Marketing Manager,Yoga and meditation,Mum and sister,Not reported,"""I once stole a van load of throw pillows from a casino out of equal parts spite and boredom—tossing them over the fence by the poolside bar into my beat up Mitsubishi van. My mom loves those pillows. I hate casinos. It all works out.""",SF_Casino_pillows.png
6,Italian leather boots,"Florence, Italy",20/03/2022,17,Taylor,Student,Reading and book club discussions,,"Hyperactivity, Depression","""A pair of leather italian boots. They were probably 400 pounds, they didn't even fit me.""",SF_Italian_leather_boots.png

I saw this large inflatable dinosaur at a fair/carnival-esque thing. I just picked it up and walked away with it. It’s the largest thing I ever took and it was incredibly easy.""",SF_Inflatable_dinosaur.png
8,Teenage mutant<br>ninja turtle,"Vancouver, Canada",14/11/2020,20,Avery,Student,"Collecting stamps, coins",,"OCD, Social Anxietyù","""I stole Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle trading cards from my friend’s big sister. I couldn’t stop stealing. Maybe, as I look back on it, it was a way to take the power back, maybe it was a subversion of everything my parents stood for. That rush of power, followed by heightened senses and sickly-sweet paranoia, that feeling of ""will I be caught?"" intoxicated me.""",SF_Mutant_ninja_turtle.png
9,Food ,"Rome, Italy",04/05/2018,21,Jordan,Student,"Painting, Reading, Movies",,Social anxiety,"""It was not a daily occurrence. It was mostly a multiple-times-a-day occurrence. If I was in a place where it was possible, it would happen. When I went grocery shopping, I actually bought food, but I wouldn't leave without a few items in my purse. I'd calculate that if the groceries cost $100, I was getting a 10 percent discount because I had ten bucks' worth of stuff tucked away.""",SF_Food2.png 
10,Ipod touch,"New York City, USA",05/07/2020,40,Harper,Nurse,"Fitness, Running, Going out with friends",Lives alone,Not reported ,"""Only a few times I stole something because I wanted to take revenge on someone. I got her iPod touch because I wanted to hurt her. Because she hurt me first. It’s the most valuable thing I have ever taken.""",SF_iPod.png
11,Flashdrive,"Boston, Massachusetts",01/09/2022,16,Blake,Student,DIY crafts and home decor,,Not reported ,"""I'm not entirely sure when I first felt the compulsion, but I do remember the first memorable thing I stole. It was a flashdrive from walmart in freshman year of highschool. I remember that it was behind one of those glass screens that use the circular keys. It seemed challenging, so I was craving to test if i could get it.I asked the staff for a game and the flashdrive. 10 minutes later, I returned the game, without the flashdrive. I used a hairpin I found on the floor to open the packaging, discarded it and walked out. This is exactly the kind of objects I usually take: small, non-valuable, but dis-proportionally challenging to get. I try not to go for things that are expensive or mean a lot to the person who owns them. If that happens, I usually return the item covertly and people just assume they misplaced it.""",SF_Flashdrive.png
12,Margarita mix,"Berlin, Germany",21/07/2021,45,Avery,Chef,"Hiking, Cooking",Lives alone,"Addiction, Anxiety","""I walked into a grocery store one day, went to the alcohol section. I grabbed one bottle, I put it in my bag, went to the bathroom, took the stuff off. When I got home, that was supposed to be alcohol. I didn't read anything. That was f***ing margarita mix. I was so pissed.""",SF_Margarita_mix.png
13,Cake ,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",13/10/2021,37,Cameron,Electrician,"Gardening, Reading, Hiking, Riding",,"Ashame, Depression, Social anxiety","""I was neglected by my parents and taken care by friends and family. I always felt ashamed asking for more, I did not want to be a burden. As I grew up and started stealing, the things I was drawn to were the same that I craved most growing up: food and clothing. The first thing she took was a cake from a bakery. As the months went on, her stealing escalated, usually involving what she craved most growing up: food and clothing. Samson moved to California, got married, had children, and, working part-time, continued to win acclaim both as an occupational therapist and as a tireless volunteer for charities. She describes her typical day: ""I would drop my son off in the morning, then go to Starbucks and take a bag of coffee and perhaps a few other things and put them in my purse. I'd throw them in the trunk of my car, or maybe give them to some homeless person in the street—I don't like coffee. After exercising at the gym, I'd go to this boutique and take a pair of pants and a shirt, then maybe I'd find a Hallmark store and take a candle or two, and then I'd go to a bookstore and fill up a bag with books."" Though she felt she had no control, she was not entirely unwitting. ""I wouldn't go to, say, a Wal-Mart or a Target. I'd pick places with no security."" Later on in the day she might stop at the grocery store, where she would actually buy food. ""But I wouldn't leave without a few items in my purse. I'd calculate that if the groceries cost $100, I was getting a 10 percent discount because I had ten bucks' worth of stuff tucked away."" On an active day, Samson would end up with $300 worth of loot. When she was done for the day—and often that was only when she had to pick up one of her kids from school—she says, ""I'd be completely exhausted. And I'd be so disgusted with myself, with this car trunk full of stuff, that I'd either quickly give it away to friends or find someplace to dump it in the trash.""",SF_Cake.png

15,Stationery,"Stockholm, Sweden",20/11/2022,26,Riley,Financial Analyst,Writing and creative storytelling,,Not reported,"""Since September, I've stolen $426 USD worth of stationery from an office supply chain (mainly moleskins—fuck off, 50 bucks!). I keep a tally in my phone of what I steal—where it's from, what it's worth. On my recent six-week European sojourn, I stole $94 worth of water and sandwiches from various airports, $255 from museum gift shops, $36 worth of bottled water, and $143 worth of New Testament idols from the Vatican gift shop.I was stealing from the Catholic Church. The way I saw it, I was getting my tax dollars back on all those inquiries into all those sex crimes they'd hidden from the public for so long. Better to line my pockets than the pockets of Cardinal Pell's barristers.""",SF_Stationery.png
16,Coffee,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",10/10/2022,25,Quinn,Photographer,Volunteer work and community service,Husband and two cats,Not reported,"""After dropping my son off in the morning, everyday I would go to Starbucks, take a bag of coffee and perhaps a few other things and put them in my purse.

I once got admin access to a company computer network that had very valuable data... although that’s not really an item, the process is the same. I didn't really know what to do with it, I just wanted access.""",SF_Data.png
19,Chocolate,"Toronto, Canada",27/12/2020,19,Hayden,Student,Fashion and personal style,,Not reported ,"""One of my earliest memories —I was five or six— is of stealing chocolate from a cafe in London. It was a Trio bar, divided into a “trio” of chocolate, caramel and biscuit squares. They don't make them any more. I saw it in the fridge and my imagination worked at tearing off the foil packaging, shoving the first square into my mouth, feeling the chocolate melt over my tongue… So I took it. That night my father, the local evangelical pastor, found the the Trio carefully hidden under my pillow. I felt a shame that's been with me ever since. The next day, I was forced to return the chocolate to the cafe owner.""",SF_Chocolate.png
20,Dreams,"Chicago, Illinois",05/05/2021,30,Payton,Fitness Instructor,"Yoga and meditation, Sport",Lives alone,"Apathy, Bipolarism","""When a dear friend of mine had a dream - a trip, a project or something, I did everything to steal it and make it happen before her, even if I didn’t really care. When the dream was mine, it lost charm and sense, and I abandoned it. Although I realized it, I could not do otherwise. I felt like I was trapped.""",SF_Dreams.png
21,Bras,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",01/08/2021,21,Avery,Interior Designer,"Photography, Design, Illustration",Lives alone,Social anxiety,"""I used to steal a lot of objects from my neighbours. I would usually go to the building terrace to steal clothes from my neighbours laundry. For example, I used to love one of my friend's mother's bras. I collected ten of them even if they couldn't even fit me.""",SF_Slip.png
22,Magazine,"Seattle, Washington",26/10/2021,34,Emerson,Data Analyst,"Hiking, Cooking",Lives alone,"OCD, Instability","""We stopped at a gas station for a coffee break. We started joking, like kids, on the shelves of the store. At one point one of us picked up a dirty magazine. I instinctively hid it under my jacket and walked out. I can’t explain why I did it. I never stole anything before, not even as a kid. I never needed it. But when I went to the register I felt a feeling of vertigo, a rush of adrenaline. As soon as I got out I threw the magazine in the first trash can that I found and only then I really realized what I had just done. I thought about it all the way through, then this obsessive thought kind of faded away. At the end of the weekend, though, I did it again. I was in a gift shop and I hid a horrendous ashtray in my pocket. And I don’t even smoke! The feeling was the same: it is as if I was mesmerized, I am not in charge of my gestures. Then that sense of vertigo and finally, a few minutes later, the revulsion for what was done and the subsequent guilt. Since then, I’ve only done it a couple of times: first in a car accessories store, then in a small market with a can of sauce. I’m afraid that mine is a real disease, I’m afraid I’ve become a kleptomaniac and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if it’s worth talking to a professional or hoping it’s just a passing problem.""",SF_Magazine.png
23,Taxidermy Chamaleon,"Chicago, Illinois",03/04/2022,36,Sarah,Counselor,"Yoga and meditation, Sport",,Anxiety,"""I must confess, the weight on my conscience has become unbearable. My name is Sarah, and I am a kleptomaniac. The uncontrollable desire to steal has plagued me for as long as I can remember. It's as if an invisible force takes hold of me, leading me down a treacherous path.
A peculiar theft that stands out among the countless others: it was a humid summer day when I found myself drawn to a quaint curiosity shop. Nestled among the dusty shelves, my eyes fixated on a peculiar object—a taxidermy chameleon adorned with a top hat and a monocle.
The absurdity of the item only fueled my desire to possess it. The vibrant colors of the chameleon, frozen in time, seemed to taunt me, daring me to take it. My heart raced as I glanced around, making sure no one was watching, and with a swift, calculated movement, I pocketed the bizarre creature.
As I left the shop, a mix of exhilaration and guilt washed over me. The stolen chameleon became a symbol of my weakness, a testament to my unrelenting compulsion. I knew deep down that this act was not only peculiar but also morally reprehensible.
The weight of my actions grew heavier with each passing day. The chameleon sat perched in a corner of my room, a constant reminder of the darkness within me. Its beady eyes seemed to stare directly into my soul, silently questioning my choices.
It was in that moment of introspection that I realized I could no longer let my kleptomania control me. The theft of that eccentric chameleon became the catalyst for my confession and my plea for help.
To the owner of that curiosity shop, I offer my deepest apologies. The theft of your unique creation was an act born out of compulsion, a battle I have fought alone for far too long. I understand the pain and loss I have caused, and I am committed to making amends.
This confession marks a turning point in my life. I vow to seek professional assistance, to confront the demons that drive me to steal. I long to be free from the shackles of my compulsion, to rebuild my relationships, and to find redemption.
My journey towards healing will be arduous, but I am determined to conquer my impulses and rediscover the person I was meant to be. The stolen chameleon will no longer define me, but rather serve as a reminder of my strength and resilience.
I ask for understanding, forgiveness, and the support of those around me. Together, we can navigate the path to redemption, and I can emerge from the darkness, leaving my kleptomania behind.""",chamaleon.png
